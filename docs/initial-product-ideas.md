## Core Concept: The Stable Metaphor

### Why Horses/Stables Work for TPM Learning
1. **Growth & Care**: Horses need consistent care → Skills need consistent practice
2. **Multiple Specialties**: Different horse breeds → Different tech specialties (Cloud, ML, APIs)
3. **Progressive Mastery**: Training horses → Mastering technical concepts
4. **Portfolio Building**: Show horses → Portfolio projects
5. **Community**: Stable community → Learning community
6. **Achievement**: Blue ribbons → Certifications and badges

### The 7 Stables (Milestones)
Each milestone is represented as a different area of the stable grounds, with unique horses to unlock:

1. **Training Arena** (SDLC/DevOps)
   - Horse: "Pipeline" - A reliable brown workhorse
   - Theme: Practice and repetition, building foundations
   
2. **Feed Storage Barn** (Data/SQL)
   - Horse: "Query" - An analytical grey mare
   - Theme: Understanding what nourishes decisions (data)
   
3. **Open Pastures** (Cloud Infrastructure)
   - Horse: "Nimbus" - A white cloud-spotted stallion
   - Theme: Scalability and freedom
   
4. **Main Stable Complex** (System Design)
   - Horse: "Blueprint" - A strong architectural build
   - Theme: Structure and design
   
5. **Riding Trails** (API/Platform)
   - Horse: "Connector" - A social, path-making horse
   - Theme: Building connections and pathways
   
6. **Breeding Barn** (Machine Learning)
   - Horse: "Darwin" - A learning, adaptive horse
   - Theme: Growth through iteration and learning
   
7. **Show Arena** (GenAI/LLMs)
   - Horse: "Ava" (AI) - A spectacular performer
   - Theme: Cutting-edge performance
