## Technical Notes for Figma Make
- Use auto-layout for responsive components
- Create component variants for button states
- Build a design system library with colors, typography, icons
- Include sample content from the Tech PM Codex
- Design both light mode initially (dark mode future consideration)
- Export ready for development handoff

## Mood and Tone
- **Welcoming**: Like entering a well-maintained, cozy stable
- **Encouraging**: Progress feels rewarding, mistakes are learning opportunities
- **Professional but Playful**: Serious content delivered in an engaging way
- **Feminine but Universal**: Pink/brown palette appeals to target user but remains inclusive
- **Growth-Oriented**: Visual metaphor of caring for horses mirrors skill development

---

**Final Note**: The stable/horse theme should enhance the learning experience, not distract from it. Technical content remains clear and accessible while the gamification layer adds motivation and joy to the learning journey.
